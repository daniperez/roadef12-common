How to use roadef11-common
==========================

roadef11-common is a header-only library. You can find in
example/ExampleMain.cpp an example about how to use the library.

In summary the steps shown ExampleMain are:

    i. Subclass Service class (roadef11-common/service/Service.hpp).
       Only Service::optimize and constructor have to be redefined.
   ii. Call your Service subclass with the input given by 
       ProgramOptions class (roadef11-common/service/ProgramOptions.hpp).
  iii. Service class has the "params" attribute with the problem
       parameters. "options" contains the command line options passed
       to the executable in ProgramOptions. "firstAssignment" contains
       the initial assignment of processes to machines.

The only dependencies of the library are the STL and Boost's shared_ptr
and foreach.
